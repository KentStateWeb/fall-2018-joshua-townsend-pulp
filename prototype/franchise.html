      <h2>Want to become a partner?</h2>
      <p>Pulp isn’t like all the other franchisors out there. We maintain an excellent reputation by being selective as to who we work
        with and this selectiveness shows in the success of our locations. Pulp is different from other smoothie shops because we offer
        more such as our full menu of wraps to go with our smoothies. As a franchisee, you won’t be alone with your franchise. Thom and
        his team, located in Northeast Ohio, offer a comprehensive training program for all franchise operations to get your whole team
        ready. Our team will also assist with site selection, location preparation and marketing! If you encounter any problems along the
        way, we will always be available to help. If you’re serious about joining the Pulp franchisee family, fill out the form below.</p>
